<h1>Ellipses</h1>
<p> "The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at a focus." Johannes Kepler exclaimed after
    observing Mars for several years and tracking its motion around the sun. Similar to planets traveling around the sun, satalleties
    also orbit the earth in elliptical paths. Lets first go over the make up of an ellipse:

<p> As demonstrated above, the satellite (green moving circle) is traveling around the Earth 
    which is a focus. The other focus (also referred to as the vacant focus) is another point in space 
    symmetrical to the Earth just on the opposite side.

A satellite in a low orbit (or low part of an elliptical orbit) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit (or a high part of an elliptical orbit), due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet.
If thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite's orbit, it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit, though the rest of its path will change. Thus one cannot move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust.
From a circular orbit, thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite's motion changes orbit to elliptical; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point (the periapse) at 180 degrees away from the firing point; then it will ascend back. Thrust applied in the direction of the satellite's motion creates an elliptical orbit with an apoapse 180 degrees away from the firing point.
The consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive. For example, if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock, unless they are very close, the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to go faster. This will change the shape of its orbit, causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft, missing the target. The space rendezvous before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods requiring hours or even days to complete.
To the degree that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold, actual trajectories will vary 
from those calculated. For example, simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for 
objects in low Earth orbit. These rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or 
more bodies of similar mass, such as a binary star system (see n-body problem). Celestial mechanics
 uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations. Kepler's laws of planetary 
 motion, which can be mathematically derived from Newton's laws, hold strictly only in describing 
 the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces; they also 
 describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories. In the close proximity of large objects like 
 stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important.</p>
