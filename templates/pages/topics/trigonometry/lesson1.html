<p>A right triangle has two sides called legs which meet at a right angle and a third side called the hypotenuse. 
If angle A is being referenced, the side opposite this angle is usually labeled as a lower case letter a and the side or leg adjacent to the referenced angle is side b.
Side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B and the hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle C, is c. The angles of a right triangle consist of a right angle (90째) and two acute angles (an acute angle is an angle with measure less than 90째).
The Pythagorean Theorem is a useful relationship that holds for all right triangles. Using our labelling system, it can be written as a2 + b2 = c2.
The triangles shown in the figure below all have an angle of 35째. Therefore, the remaining acute angle has a measure of 55째. The length of corresponding sides are proportional.
This means that the ratio of any two sides in one triangle is the same as the the ratio of the same corresponding sides in another triangle. Triangles with this relationship are said to be similar.
